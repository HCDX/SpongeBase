Two Directories
 -> SpongeWeb
 -> SpongeNative

Sponge web has the actions, business logic etc needed to run the app with hot loading on the web
 - bootstrapped with "react-create-app"
SpongeNative
 - Bootstrapped with "create-react-native-app"
 - not working on this currently, focusing first on the react app itself.

 The idea here is that once the web app is created, we can hook these two together, using the actions from the web to facilitate the development of the ios / android apps.



- trying a number of approaches to get a front end build working
- react-native create app ( sponge package )
- react-native-web-hello-world
