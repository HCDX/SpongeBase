# SpongeBase
Interactive data mash-up of Lebanon's locations and interventions 

A joint project by UNHCR/UNICEF Innovation leads in Lebanon.
Project overview 
Data on geographical locations (governorates, districts, cities, villages, camps, schools etcâ€¦) in a humanitarian response is often scattered in different locations, whether in databases, folders, assessment reports, and information sharing websites. A lot of effort is spent on collating available information for secondary data reviews as well as for profiling certain geographical location for operational importance. 
The idea of this project is to automatically collate available information from different data sources in a simple format and linking them to a geographical location like a governorate, district, village or even a small camp. 
SpongeBase is composed of a dynamic map interface (SpongeMap) and a web app/interface (DOG).
